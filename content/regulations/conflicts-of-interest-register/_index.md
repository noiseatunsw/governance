title: Conflict of Interest Policy
---

## 1. Purpose

This policy outlines the expectations for members of the Noise editorial team regarding conflicts of interest. It is designed to uphold the integrity and impartiality of editorial content by ensuring all conflicts, whether direct or indirect, are disclosed and managed appropriately.

## 2. Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest

All members of the Noise editorial team are required to disclose any interests that conflict with their editorial responsibilities, particularly where such interests may impact their ability to produce or edit content fairly. This applies to both direct conflicts and external interests arising from their editorial position.

## 3. Misuse of Information

Editors must not use any non-public information obtained through their official duties to secure financial or other advantages for themselves or any other entity or individual.

## 4. Conflict of Interest Register

The conflict of interest register shall be maintained by the Noise editorial team and will operate on a self-declaration basis.

It is expected that the following roles are declared within the register:

- Positions within University bodies (including University Council, Academic Board, Faculty Boards, volunteer positions, and employment with the university),   
- Positions within Arc (including SRC, PGC, IRC, Arc Board, volunteer positions, and employment with Arc),  
- Club executive or subcommittee positions,  
- Employment, membership, volunteering, or candidacy with any political party or candidate for a local, state, or federal seat,  
- Campaigning or candidacy in an SRC, PGC, Arc Board, or other Arc or UNSW election, including involvement in a ticket or other organised group for the purpose of that election.

Editors will be added to the register following their first meeting in which they assume their role, or within ten (10) business days if no such meeting occurs within that time frame. For the purpose of intialisation, individuals who are editors of Noise on the date that the register is formed will have 10 business days to complete their obligations to add items to the register.

Editors will remain on the register until six (6) months after their departure from Noise.

A version control system will be utilized to archive previous iterations of the register.

## 5. Restrictions on Content Approval and Publication

Editors must not publish content where they are aware of a conflict of interest unless explicit approval has been granted by the coordinators. Prior to granting approval, the coordinators must make reasonable attempts to consult with the chair, president, or equivalent authority, unless it is determined after receiving legal advice that whistleblower policies or similar protections apply.

For example, an editor who is also a Student Representative Council (SRC) member should not publish coverage of an SRC meeting, as this would constitute a conflict of interest. However, they may be permitted to publish content related to a campaign or protest within their portfolio, subject to approval.

Under no circumstances may an editor approve content where they are aware of a conflict of interest.

## 6. Sanctions for Non-Compliance

An editor may be subject to removal or other sanctions under the Dispute Resolution Policy (DRP) if they

1. Misuse information gained through their involvement in Noise for the benefit, whether direct or indirect, of themselves, another person, or another organisation,  
2. Fail to disclose a conflict of interest; and  
   1. Publish content materially related to that conflict of interest; or  
   2. Approve content materially related to that conflict of interest.  

Note that failure to disclose a conflict of interest alone does not constitute a violation of the DRP; the violation arises from both the failure to disclose and the subsequent publication or approval of related content.

## 7. Review Period

This policy is subject to annual review to ensure its continued effectiveness in maintaining the integrity of editorial processes.
