# Conflicts of Interest Register

In accordance with the Conflicts of Interest Register Policy, all editors are required to maintain a list of conflicts of interest that could significantly preclude them from producing or evaluating content in a fair manner. This register uses a self-declaration system, although there are potential repercussions enabled by the Policy for failing to declare a conflict of interest.

Given that the Constitution requires all editors to be UNSW students, it is implicit that all editors have an interest in maintaining the reputation of the University. However, blocking all UNSW students from publishing content about the university would be impractical. Therefore, the restrictions on producing and approving content where an editor has a conflict of interest is ignored for the purpose of covering the university.

Editors who sit on governance bodies (such as UNSW Council, Academic Board, Faculty Boards, and the subcommittees for each of these) are precluded from approving coverage about the bodies and subcommittees which they sit on.

Editors who are employed by the university are precluded from covering their division (for those employed as professional staff) or their faculty (for those employed as educational staff).
